# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

This is also where I can plan.
I want to be able to 
* log in and say where I'm going for lunch
* see where other people are going for lunch without logging in
* use github to log in
* post to site through slackbot
* use site on phone
